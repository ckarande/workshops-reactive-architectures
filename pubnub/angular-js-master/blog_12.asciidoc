== Zero to Angular in Seconds - Live Tutorial, Video & Presentation Slides Available! ==

Hello hello, and thank you for checking out our series on
building real-time applications using AngularJS and PubNub.
In one of the http://goo.gl/rGOXGm[early episodes] of our
popular http://goo.gl/hSzaQo[blog series], I give an example
of a working chat application in less than 100 lines of HTML
and JavaScript.

Folks were really excited about that idea, so I presented some
of this recent work as a tutorial at the http://goo.gl/gHfsVJ[Boston AngularJS Meetup]
in early September, showing CodePen.io examples alongside an
exploratory/interactive presentation for "Zero to Angular".

Please check these resources out and let us know what you think!
The idea is that you should be able to run the CodePen in one
browser window, click through the presentation in another, and
even listen to the video if you're so inclined!

* Live CodePens for PubNub and AngularJS versions: http://goo.gl/rPwPcv[1.0.x], http://goo.gl/V57eM3[1.1.x], http://goo.gl/9u7pEm[1.2.x], http://goo.gl/duajLi[1.3.x]
* http://goo.gl/KDa5j3[SpeakerDeck Presentation]
* http://goo.gl/GjwVpr[Presentation Video on YouTube]

...And that's it! Hopefully the Zero to Angular blog series has
helped you get started with PubNub and AngularJS with near-zero effort.
Please keep in touch and reach out if you have https://github.com/pubnub/angular-js/issues[ideas].
